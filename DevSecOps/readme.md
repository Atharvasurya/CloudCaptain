## Tools

### Dependency Management

Open source software packages can speed up the development process by allowing developers to implement functionality without having to write all of the code. However, with the open source code comes open source vulnerabilities. Dependency management tools help manage vulnerabilities in open source packages by identifying and updating packages with known vulnerabilities.

- [Deepfence ThreatMapper](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper) - Apache v2, powerful runtime vulnerability scanner for kubernetes, virtual machines and serverless.

- [Snyk Open Source](https://snyk.io/) - _Snyk_ - Automated vulnerable dependency monitoring and upgrades using Snyk's dedicated vulnerability database.

### Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) is a form of black-box security testing where a security scanner interacts with a running instance of an application, emulating malicious activity to find common vulnerabilities. DAST tools are commonly used in the initial phases of a penetration test, and can find vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection, cross-site request forgery and information disclosure.

- [Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) - _OWASP_ - An open-source web application vulnerability scanner, including an API for CI/CD integration.

### Infrastructure as Code Analysis

Infrastructure as Code allows applications to be deployed reliably to a consistent environment. This not only ensures that infrastructure is consistently hardened, but also provides an opportunity to statically and dynamically analyse infrastructure definitions for vulnerable dependencies, hard-coded secrets, insecure configuration and unintentional changes in security configuration. The following tools facilitate this analysis.

#### Multi-Platform

- [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) - _Bridgecrew_ - Scan Terraform, AWS CloudFormation and Kubernetes templates for insecure configuration.
- [KICS](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics) - _Checkmarx_ - Find security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations early in the development cycle.

### Intentionally Vulnerable Applications

Intentionally vulnerable applications are often useful when developing security tests and tooling to provide a place you can run tests and make sure they fail correctly. These applications can also be useful for understanding how common vulnerabilities are introduced into applications and let you practice your skills at exploiting them.

### Monitoring
It's not enough to test and harden our software in the lead up to a release. We must also monitor our production software for usage, performance and errors to capture malicious behavior and potential security flaws that we may need to respond to or address. A wide variety of tools are available to monitor different aspects of production software and infrastructure.

- [Csper](https://csper.io/report-uri) - _Csper_ - A set of Content Security Policy tools that can test policies, monitor CSP reports and provide metrics and alerts.

### Secrets Management

The software we write needs to use secrets (passwords, API keys, certificates, database connection strings) to access resources, yet we cannot store secrets within the codebase as this leaves them vulnerable to compromise. Secret management tools provide a means to securely store, access and manage secrets.

- [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) - _Ansible_ - Securely store secrets within Ansible pipelines.

### Secrets Scanning

Source control is not a secure place to store secrets such as credentials, API keys or tokens, even if the repo is private. Secrets scanning tools can scan and monitor git repositories and pull-requests for secrets, and can be used to prevent secrets from being committed, or to find and remove secrets that have already been committed to source control.

- [truffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) - _Truffle Security_ - Searches through git repositories for secrets, digging deep into commit history and branches.

### Static Analysis

Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools scan software for vulnerabilities without executing the target software. Typically, static analysis will scan the source code for security flaws such as the use of unsafe functions, hard-coded secrets and configuration issues. SAST tools often come in the form of IDE plugins and CLIs that can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

### Supply Chain Security

Supply chain attacks come in different forms, targeting parts of the SDLC that are inherently 3rd party: tools in CI, external code that's been executed, and more. Supply chain security tooling can defend against these kinds of attacks.

- [Harden Runner GitHub Action](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) - _StepSecurity_ - installs a security agent on the GitHub-hosted runner (Ubuntu VM) to prevent exfiltration of credentials, detect compromised dependencies and build tools, and detect tampering of source code during the build.
- [Preflight](https://github.com/spectralops/preflight) - _Spectral_ - helps you verify scripts and executables to mitigate supply chain attacks in your CI and other systems, such as in the recent [Codecov hack](https://spectralops.io/blog/credentials-risk-supply-chain-lessons-from-the-codecov-breach/).
- [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) - sigstore is a set of free to use and open source tools, including [fulcio](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio), [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) and [rekor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor), handling digital signing, verification and checks for provenance needed to make it safer to distribute and use open source software.

### Threat Modelling

Threat modelling is an engineering exercise that aims to identify threats, vulnerabilities and attack vectors that represent a risk to something of value.  Based on this understanding of threats, we can design, implement and validate security controls to mitigate threats. The following list of tools assist the threat modelling process.

- [Awesome Threat Modelling](https://github.com/hysnsec/awesome-threat-modelling) - _Practical DevSecOps_ - A curated list of threat modelling resources.
- [SecuriCAD](https://www.foreseeti.com/) - _Forseeti_ - Treat modelling and attack simulations for IT infrastructure.
- [IriusRisk](https://iriusrisk.com/) - _IriusRisk_ - Draw threat models and capture threats and countermeasures and manage risk.
- [Raindance Project](https://github.com/devsecops/raindance) - _DevSecOps_ - Use attack maps to identify attack surface and adversary strategies that may lead to compromise.
- [SD Elements](https://www.securitycompass.com/sdelements/threat-modeling/) - _Security Compass_ - Identify and rank threats, generate actionable tasks and track related tickets.
- [Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/) - _OWASP_ - Threat model diagramming tool.
