##### What is DevOps ?

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

DevOps process can be visualized as an infinite loop, comprising these steps: plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor.

##### DevOps and Cloud computing: What is the need?
Development and Operations are considered to be one single entity in the DevOps practice. This means that any form of Agile development, alongside Cloud Computing, will give it a straight-up advantage in scaling practices and creating strategies to bring about a change in business adaptability. If the cloud is considered to be a car, then DevOps would be its wheels

##### What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the internet with pay as you go.
If we need we can get it right way. If we dont we can give it away.
Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage and process data rather than a local server or a personal computer.
Features:
1. On demand provisioning
2. Scalability in minutes: We can scale out, or scale in

    ###### Cloud models:
        Public
        Private
        Hybrid
        Community


##### LAMP Architecture
LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Together, they provide a proven set of software for delivering high-performance web applications.

##### Name some common top DevOps tools.
A. Some top DevOps tools are Chef, Puppet, and Ansible as Configuration Management and Deployment Tools, Git as a Version Control System Tool, Jenkins as a Continuous Integration Tool, Docker as an effective Containerization Tool, and Nagios as a Continuous Monitoring Tool.

##### What is the main goal of DevOps?
A. The main goal of DevOps is to optimize the flow of value from the idea to the end-user and make the delivery of value effective and efficient. DevOps also focuses on culture and cultural changes in the company in a big way.

##### What is the primary difference between agile and DevOps?

A. The essential difference between the two is that while agile is about increasing the efficiency of developers and development cycles, DevOps allows continuous integration and continuous delivery by utilizing the operations team.

##### What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source tool in Java for automation and Continuous Integration tasks. Jenkins allows users to create and test their projects continuously while integrating changes quickly. One of the biggest highlights of Jenkins is its large number of plugins. Plugins allow Jenkins to integrate with other software solutions and enhance its capabilities in multitudes.

Jenkins can integrate the entire development life-cycle process of an application. This means it can handle creation, testing, packaging, deployment, analysis, and other operations. 

##### What is Ansible?
A product of RedHat, Ansible is a management tool for service deployment.
 It is an open-source solution for software provisioning, application deployment, and configuration management; Ansible has become increasingly popular because it offers its users numerous facilities.
 You can automate multiple IT processes by using Ansible. Moreover, its design is for multi-tier deployment so it can handle your different systems together.

##### TOMCAT SERVER
Tomcat is used for web applications written in Java that don’t require full Java EE specifications but still need a reliable tool. We can develop web applications in Java EE technologies and use Tomcat as a web server to automate the web component execution process. The Tomcat server provides one set of Servlet and JSP containers.

##### What is a Web Server?
Whenever you open your browser, type a URL and then click enter. Basically, you are requesting the contents of that URL.
Web Servers are computers that deliver the requested web pages. Every web server has an IP address and domain name.

##### What is Nginx?
It is open-source software designed for maximum performance and stability.
Nginx is a dedicated web server that has solved efficiency issues and provided us with an optimum way to handle 1000s of requests concurrently.

###### Features of Nginx are as follows:

1. It provides HTTP server capabilities.
2. Designed to provide stability and maximum performance.
3. Functions as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP).
4. It uses an event-driven and non-threaded architecture to provide less CPU computation per request served.
5. It provides scalability.
6. Reduces wait time for the client.
7. Upgrades can be done while Nginx is hosting a website without any downtime.

##### What is CI/CD, and how does AWS play a role in it?

The combined processes of continuous integration and continuous delivery, also known as a continuous deployment (CD), are known as CI/CD in the field of software engineering. By mandating automation in creating, testing, and deploying applications, CI/CD fills the gaps between production and operational activities and teams. The progressive code changes made by programmers are compiled, linked, and packaged into software deliverables via CI/CD services.

##### How would you define Continuous Testing in DevOps?
A. Continuous testing is the execution of automated tests every time a piece of code is merged. This makes it possible for engineers to get immediate feedback on the most recent merging of code. Automation of tests is encouraged throughout the development cycle through principles of continuous testing.
