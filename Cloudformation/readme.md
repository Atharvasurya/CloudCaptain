# Cloudformation-Concepts
AWS CloudFormation is a tool to write the Infrastructure as a Code(IaC). Any kind of AWS resources such as VPCs, EC2, S3, RDS or any other kind of resources can be created using AWS CloudFormation. We can define any AWS resource in a JSON or a YANL file.

This has a lot of advantages such as:

1. Automation of AWS resource creation
2. Disaster recovery
3. Copying a resource from one aws region to another region
4. Code review of the infrastructure and many more.

Cloudformation uses stacks to create resources. A stack might contain one or more resources.

The JSON/YAML template has four important top-level keys:

1. AWSTemplateFormatVersion
2. Resource - The AWS resources you want to create 
3. Parameter - The configuration parameters for the AWS resource with the template
4. Output - The properties of the resource you want to output
